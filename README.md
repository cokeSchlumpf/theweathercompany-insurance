# HackZurich - A quick demo on how to use The Weather Company API

This is a quick demo I coded this morning to show how quickly you can create a meaningful app with The Weather Cannel API and IBM Bluemix Services.

The application uses: 

* The Weather Company Data API
* IBM Watson Conversation Service
* IBM Cloud Functions
* MapQuest Routing API
* Facebook Messenger Platform

The secrets and API keys are included in the code, all of them will be invaidated after HackZurich 2017. 
See and try the sample code in `./twc-rate-action` to see how to use The Weather Company Data API.

If you have questions regarding The Weather Company API, IBM Bluemix or IBM Watson services stop by at the IBM/ Swiss Re/ Eurapco Boot at Hack Zurich 2017 :)
